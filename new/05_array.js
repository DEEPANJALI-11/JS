// In JavaScript, both slice() and substring() are string methods used to extract a portion of a string and return it as a new string.
// While they often produce the same result, there are key differences in their behavior: 
// Handling of Negative Indices:
// slice(): Accepts negative indices, which are treated as an offset from the end of the string. For example, str.slice(-3) extracts the last three characters. 
// substring(): Treats negative indices as 0.
// Handling of startIndex greater than endIndex:
// slice(): If startIndex is greater than endIndex, slice() returns an empty string. 
// substring(): If startIndex is greater than endIndex, substring() automatically swaps the two arguments and then extracts the substring.
// Flexibility of Arguments:
// slice(): Can be used on both strings and arrays.
// substring(): Can only be used on strings.

console.log(str); //   khushi   
console.log(str.trim());//khushi remove starting and endinh blank spaces
